I’m Aymeric, an engineering manager with a technical range spanning embedded, platform, and product engineering, from 8-bit microcontrollers to generative AI. My career across the e-commerce, defense, and automotive industries has taken me from Europe to Japan, working with teams across four continents and 50 countries.

Currently, I lead engineering teams at Mercari, Japan's leading C2C marketplace, where I drive global expansion. I blend engineering and product management to architect complex systems and design A/B tests.

This space is where I share my thoughts on technology, leadership, and my personal projects.
