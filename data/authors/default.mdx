Aymeric is an engineer and engineering manager with experiences in the e-commerce, defense and automotive sectors.

He is as comfortable architecting generative AI features or Kafka topic partitions as he is evaluating Minimum Detectable Effects in A/B tests or discussing 8-bit microcontroller registers.

Leveraging systems thinking and a problem-solving mindset, Aymeric bridges the gap between stakeholders across engineering, product, design, marketing, legal and beyond, to deliver complex projects.
